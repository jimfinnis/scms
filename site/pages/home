##
## A page file consists of a bunch of template assignments to be written
## to the templating system, with the exception of the 'template' value
## which determines which template to use (if present - otherwise it's the
## default as specified in the configuration).
## If there exists a file of the same name in the current language's
## subdirectory, both files are read with the language file overriding
## the values set in this file.
##
## In the template, variables set here are referred to with the prefix
## page:, for example {{page:content_left}}. This is to distinguish
## them from system or global content templates.

name=Home Page

content=[[
        <p>This is the home page.</p>
