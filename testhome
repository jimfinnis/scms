#
# A page file consists of a bunch of template assignments to be written
# to the templating system, with the exception of the 'template' value
# which determines which template to use (if present - otherwise it's the
# default as specified in the configuration).
# If there exists a file of the same name in the current language's
# subdirectory, both files are read with the language file overriding
# the values set in this file.
#
# In the template, variables set here are referred to with the prefix
# page:, for example {{page:content_left}}. This is to distinguish
# them from system or global content templates.

content=[[
This is a default home page. This block appears as the contents of the
tag <b>page:content</b>, which is used by the default template.
