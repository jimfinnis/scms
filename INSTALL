Steps for installation

* Copy index.php into the target directory
* Copy (or link) 'core' into the target directory
* Run createdirs in your target directory
* Copy the default config.php (called default_config.php) into your site directory as config.php
* Edit the values
* Copy or link the required NLS files from NLSFiles into site/languages
* Copy a default template directory into site/templates
* Create a home page in the site/pages directory
* Create a site/navigation file referencing that page
* You'll probably want to create a 404 template and pages, too.
* Build the site.

Once the site is stable, set up the CACHING and BROWSERCACHING defines in config.php,
and add the appropriate pages to your cache_exceptions.
